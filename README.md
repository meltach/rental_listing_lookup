This app will allow you to look at rental listings in your region (US only).
For real-time real estate data, I used the Rapid API. Because the api does not provide photos for all property listings, I chose to use dummy images for all of them. I considered using Google's Static Street Images, but they are not free :(

As I worked on this application, I learned how to use APIs (Rapid and Goodle) and how to populate Google's Map with custom data (Marker).
